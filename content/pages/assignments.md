Students will each be responsible to supply questions for one week’s reading and to kick off the discussion that week.

At the end of the first two sections of the course, students will each write a 3–5 page essay focusing on the themes and readings they have found most thought provoking. These will be due during Session 5 (for Sessions 1–5) and during Session 9 (for Sessions 6–9) in class. These essays are designed to provide practice in writing the literature review of a scholarly paper.

Students will each write a 20–25 page research paper on a topic of their choosing. In order to assist the process of formulating and developing topics, students must meet the following intermediate deadlines:

*   Students will provide a general topic by Session 3, explaining why this topic is significant.
*   Students will define an argument, problem, puzzle or area of research they would like to pursue and develop by Session 4.
*   Students will write a brief statement explaining the evidence, sources, and methodology of their research project by Session 8. In addition, they will identify at least three journals that are appropriate for publishing their findings.
